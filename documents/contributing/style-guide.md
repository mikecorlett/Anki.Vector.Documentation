# Style Guide


- The title of the document should use a `#` (in Markdown). Only a single title
  (`#`) should be used.
- The heading levels should start with `##` (in Markdown) and grow in order

## Links
Links ought to be relative instead of absolute when linking to documents.  That
is to say, the should not include the full domain.
For example `/documents/some-reference/` instead of
`https://randym32.github.io/Anki.Vector.Documentation/some-reference/`
